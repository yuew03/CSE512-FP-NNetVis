## Data of a primed neural network
6 layers, 10 input nodes and 7 output nodes

512 neurons in each hidden layer 

bias node in the input and hidden layers
## Demanded features
Visualizing pruned NN architecture

Adding slider bar to control the number of links based on their weights

Highlighting the links of on-clicked input/output node

Adding the same features for bias node

Number of weights for each layer

Marking each node with details

## Task Assignment
Justin Lee: arrange group meeting with Callin, design the architecture of our project, write the report and design our poster

Yue Wang: data wrangling and coding

## Project Milestone
May 14th: 1st meeting with Callin, talked about details and demand features for his research

May 16th: team registration and project proposal submitted

May 18th: visualized the neural network for the smallest dataset successfully

May 21st: 2nd meeting with Callin, discussed network design strategy of the hidden layer and figured out details of the most complicated neural network

May 22nd: internal design meeting, decided to use axis represents the neurons in the hidden layer

May 23rd: data wrangling for the huge dataset successfully

May 25th: visualized the most complicated neural network basically

May 26th: slide bar added successfully

May 28th: bias node button added

May 30th: click and highlight feature added(Breadth First Search)

May 31st: dense progress bar added

Jun 1st: selected progress bar and details for each input/output node added

Jun 2nd: Callin demoed our visualization on his speech

Jun 3rd: design reviews with TAs

Jun 5th: changed some feature based on TA's suggestion

Jun 6th: start writing report and designing poster based on our visualization results
